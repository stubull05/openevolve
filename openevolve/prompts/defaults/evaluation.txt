Evaluate the following code on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 for the following metrics:
1. Readability: How easy is the code to read and understand?
2. Maintainability: How easy would the code be to maintain and modify?
3. Efficiency: How efficient is the code in terms of time and space complexity?

For each metric, provide a score between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 is best.

Code to evaluate:
```python
{current_program}
```

Return your evaluation as a JSON object with the following format:
{{
    "readability": [score],
    "maintainability": [score],
    "efficiency": [score],
    "reasoning": "[brief explanation of scores]"
}}
