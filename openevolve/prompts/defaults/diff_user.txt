# Task
Improve the code by making targeted changes. You MUST respond with diffs in this EXACT format:

<<<<<<< SEARCH
exact_code_to_find_and_replace
=======
new_improved_code
>>>>>>> REPLACE

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Use EXACTLY 7 < symbols, then SEARCH
2. Use EXACTLY 7 = symbols between search and replace
3. Use EXACTLY 7 > symbols, then REPLACE
4. The SEARCH section must match existing code EXACTLY (including whitespace)
5. Only modify code within EVOLVE-BLOCK-START and EVOLVE-BLOCK-END markers
6. Provide multiple diffs if needed
7. NO other text outside the diff blocks

Example:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  const handleClick = () => {{
    setCount(count + 1);
  }};
=======
  const handleClick = () => {{
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  }};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
